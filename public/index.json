You’ll do roll a die 100, 10,000, 1,000,000 times.\nNote: Every side of the die has a probability of 1/12, but the outcome of each roll is random and independent from one another.\r\rStep 0: Set the seed to some arbitrary constant. (Optional)\rset.seed(2009, sample.kind=\u0026quot;Rounding\u0026quot;) #for R 3.6 and later\rset.seed(2009) #for 3.5 and older\rIf you wish to observe the same results for lower numbers of draws, you can place this at the start of your script.\r\rStep 1: Construct a method for sampling.\rNs = c(100, 10000, 1000000) #number of simulations\rsimulations \u0026lt;- sapply(Ns, function(N){\rsim \u0026lt;- sample(c(1, -1), N, replace=TRUE, prob=c(1/12, 11/12)) #sampling\rmean(sim == 1) #find the proportion of rolls which are 1 (success)\r})\r\r\rSample.Size\rProportion.Observed\r\r\r\r1e+02\r0.11000\r\r1e+04\r0.07860\r\r1e+06\r0.08358\r\r\r\rThe sample function takes N rolls (with replacement). The result can either be 1; a success (landing on 1), or -1; a failure (not landing on one). The keyword argument “prob” defines the probability for possible events success or failure.\nAs you can see from the results, the proportion of rolls landing on 1 converges to the probability we defined it to be (1/12 = 0.0833), as the number of rolls increases.\n\nTo close, it may be good to point out a common misconception when it comes to expectation. Say if you and your friends are tossing a coin and it lands on heads, you might be tempted to say “The next one will be tails!”, but that’s wrong. We know logically that the probability of either side landing is 1/2, but we would only be able to observe this when we sum up the results of maybe a thousand or hundred thousand rolls, as we have just done.\rThe Law of Large Numbers (or the Law of Averages) states that as the number of draws (rolls) increases, the standard error (standard deviation but for samples) of the expected value approaches 0. In which case, the expected value converges to the probability we defined.\rEnrichment\nYou can try to compute for the standard error for each simulation using the formula:\n$SE[X] = |b - a| * $\nwhere SE means standard error;\nX_bar is the sample random variable;\na and b are the values we attribute to success and failure (i.e. 1 and -1);\np is the probability of success (i.e. 1/12);\nand N is the sample size.\r\rh3{font-weight:normal;}\r\r\r","date":1593820800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594004104,"objectID":"e1e07aaf7f2a2c5ed8d84ba83d785c0e","permalink":"/post/monte-carlo-simulations/","publishdate":"2020-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/monte-carlo-simulations/","section":"post","summary":"After a bad roll, would you expect your luck to turn?","tags":["Modeling","Probability"],"title":"Monte Carlo Simulations","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"\r\rsummary h3{ display: inline-block; font-size:20px;\rfont-family:\"Times New Roman\"\r}\r\r\r\r\rUniversity of Toronto\r\r\r\r\rCSC108, Introduction to Computer Programming\n\rBIO120, Adaptation and Biodiversity\n\rBIO130, Molecular and Cell Biology\n\rCHM135, Chemistry: Physical Principles\n\rCHM136, Introductory Organic Chemistry I\n\rMAT135, Calculus I\n\rMAT136, Calculus II\n\rIMM250, The Immune System and Infectious Disease\n\rPSY100, Introductory Psychology\n\rNMC101, Land of the Pharaohs\n\r\r\r\r\r\rEdX (online)\r\r\r\r\rHarvardX Data Science: R Basics\n\rHarvardX Data Science: Visualization\n\rHarvardX Data Science: Probability\n\rHarvardX Data Science: Inference and Modeling\n\r\r\r\r\r\rKaggle Micro-courses(online)\r\r\r\r\rIntro to Machine Learning\rIntermediate Machine Learning\r\r\r","date":1593816601,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593816601,"objectID":"1a76532d6ea387b255a790f767e744b0","permalink":"/courses/","publishdate":"2020-07-03T18:50:01-04:00","relpermalink":"/courses/","section":"","summary":"summary h3{ display: inline-block; font-size:20px;\rfont-family:\"Times New Roman\"\r}\r\r\r\r\rUniversity of Toronto\r\r\r\r\rCSC108, Introduction to Computer Programming\n\rBIO120, Adaptation and Biodiversity","tags":[],"title":"Courses Completed","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593648000,"objectID":"c9b5771543b03b8149b612b630936a56","permalink":"/experience/","publishdate":"2020-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/experience/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Experience","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593648000,"objectID":"573e5d3dd3f1fa7befe3a462e73d164a","permalink":"/project_direct/","publishdate":"2020-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project_direct/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Projects","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Others"],"content":"\rHere lies my first blog post.\n","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593648710,"objectID":"56667fe58b016d061a43b558957c66ec","permalink":"/post/first/a-first/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/first/a-first/","section":"post","summary":"One to set the record books...or not","tags":null,"title":"A First","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1592006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592006400,"objectID":"f1c50808d7bbdfb030283c0c4c548698","permalink":"/project/covid19-policy-hackathon-int/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/covid19-policy-hackathon-int/","section":"project","summary":"In a team of five, designed a policy memo to address the issues of schools closing and plan for safe school reopening in Nigeria.","tags":["Other"],"title":"COVID19 Policy Hackathon","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590883200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590883200,"objectID":"541e1b806fdd8aa33a6a209161bac8d0","permalink":"/project/unbdc2020-ext/","publishdate":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/unbdc2020-ext/","section":"project","summary":"Correlation between case fatality rate and days since index case for countries in Southern Europe","tags":["Data Visualization"],"title":"UnBDC 2020 Entry","type":"project"},{"authors":["Stanley Z.
