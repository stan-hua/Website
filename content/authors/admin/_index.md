Having migrated from the Philippines in 2019, my first year of university was filled with new experiences, encounters, independence, new habits for studying and living, and a greater hunger to learn. 

During my time with Prof. <a href="http://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca">Pascal Tyrrell</a>, I learned about applications of data science and deep learning in the field of medicine and medical imaging. This experience motivates me to pursue the intersection of data science and molecular biology/personalized medicine.

This summer, I will be working with Prof. <a href="http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/">Alan Moses</a> and Alex Lu to create CytoImageNet, a dataset compiling datasets of microscopy              images for use in training models to extract image features specific to cells.
