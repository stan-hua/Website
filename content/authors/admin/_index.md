Coming from the Philippines, his first year was filled with new experiences, encounters, newly-found independence, new habits for studying and living, and a greater hunger to learn. Entering his second year, he is excited to start working under Prof. <a href="http://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca"> Pascal Tyrrell </a> to understand current methodologies for determining apt sample size in machine learning studies of medical imaging data.

His biggest dream is to contribute to the field of personalized medicine and generally the practice of medicine using computational methods. For now, his goal is to enter the UofT MD/Ph.D program.
