Having just migrated from the Philippines, his first year of university was filled with new experiences, encounters,  independence, new habits for studying and living, and a greater hunger to learn. Currently, he is studying under the  <a href="http://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca"> **Tyrrell4Innovation Lab** </a> to understand medical imaging in the lens of data science and statistics, dealing with the severe lack of medical image data.

He hopes to pursue the field of personalized medicine using computational methods.
