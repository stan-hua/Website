Having migrated from the Philippines in 2019, my first year of university was filled with new experiences, encounters, independence, new habits for studying and living, and a greater hunger to learn. 

During my time with Prof. <a href="http://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca">Pascal Tyrrell</a>, I learned about common problems in applications of biostatistics and deep learning in the field of medicine and medical imaging. This experience was pivotal in directing my interests towards application of data science in healthcare (and Personalized Medicine).

This summer, I will be working with Prof. <a href="http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/">Alan Moses</a> and Alex Lu to create CytoImageNet. CytoImageNet will be an image dataset (compiling open-source microscopy data) for use in training convolutional neural networks; with the goal of providing researchers a convenient means of extracting image features specific to cell biology.
