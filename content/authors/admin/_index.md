Having migrated from the Philippines in 2019, my first year of university was filled with new experiences, encounters, independence, new habits for studying and living, and a greater hunger to learn. Currently, I am doing research  under <a href="http://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca">Prof. Pascal Tyrrell </a>, where I am learning about the use of data science, statistics and deep learning in the field of medicine and medical imaging. Particularly, my project extends a previous study that sought to understand the impact of dataset heterogeneity on model training.


In the future, I hope to continue working at the intersection of data science and molecular biology/personalized medicine.
