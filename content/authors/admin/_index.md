Having migrated from the Philippines in 2019, my first year of university was filled with new experiences, encounters, independence, new habits for living, and a greater hunger to learn. 

During my time with Prof. <a href="http://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca">Pascal Tyrrell</a>, I learned about common problems in applications of deep learning in the field of medicine and medical imaging. This experience sparked my interest in the use of data science and machine learning for improving healthcare.

I am currently working with Prof. <a href="http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/">Alan Moses</a> and <a href="http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/alexlu/">Alex Lu</a> to create CytoImageNet. CytoImageNet will be a large-scale image dataset of open-source microscopy data; for pretraining convolutional neural network models; with the goal of providing biologists a fast and automatic means for extracting biologically-relevant image features.
