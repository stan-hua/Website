Having migrated from the Philippines, his first year of university was filled with new experiences, encounters,  independence, new habits for studying and living, and a greater hunger to learn. Currently, he is working under the  <a href="http://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca"> **Tyrrell4Innovation Lab** </a> to understand the use of data science, statistics and deep learning in the field of medical imaging. 

He hopes to pursue the field of personalized medicine and/or molecular biology using deep learning methods.
