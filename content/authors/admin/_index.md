Coming from the Philippines, his first year was filled with new experiences, encounters, newly-found independence, new habits for studying and living, and a greater hunger to learn. Soon, he will be entering his second year with hopes of working under a computational lab studying genomic or medical data.

His current and most audacious goal is to enter the UofT MD/Ph.D program in Genome Biology and Bioinformatics.
